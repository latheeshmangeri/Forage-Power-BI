# PwC PowerBI Job Simulation Project

This repository contains my submission for the **PwC PowerBI Job Simulation** that I completed on Forage. The project involved analyzing datasets related to call center performance, customer retention, and diversity & inclusion, using PowerBI to create interactive dashboards and insights. Below is an overview of the project and the data files included.

## Overview

This project was part of a job simulation to demonstrate proficiency in using **PowerBI** for data visualization and analysis. The goal was to create dashboards for three different datasets to extract insights that can help in data-driven decision-making.

## Files Included

The following data files are included in this repository:

1. **[Call Centre.pbix](1.Call%20Centre%20Trends/Call%20Centre.pbix)** - Dashboard for Call Center Analysis.
2. **[Customer Retention.pbix](2.Customer%20Retention/Customer%20Retention.pbix)** - Dashboard for Customer Retention Analysis.
3. **[Diversity&Inclusion.pbix](3.Diversity%20and%20Inclusion/Diversity&Inclusion.pbix)** - Dashboard for Diversity & Inclusion Analysis.

## Project Details

### 1. Call Center Analysis

This analysis focuses on evaluating the performance of a call center, including:
- Number of calls resolved, not resolved, answered, and declined.
- Agent performance based on call resolution, average rating, and time to answer calls.
- Monthly trends in call volume.
- Insights on common call topics and customer satisfaction ratings.

### 2. Customer Retention Analysis

This analysis looks into customer demographics and retention metrics:
- Breakdown of current vs. left customers.
- Preferred payment methods, paperless billing status, and contract details.
- Usage of additional services like tech support, online security, and streaming.
- Insights on customer demographics, gender distribution, and internet service providers.

### 3. Diversity & Inclusion Analysis

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee data with a focus on diversity:
- Gender distribution across departments and job levels.
- Average performance ratings and promotion statistics.
- Job levels by gender and hiring trends.
- Analysis of employees' years of experience in the organization.
